### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, worked on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended for implementation on such a computer. So, despite stereotypes, a woman planted the early seed for programming as we know it today!
