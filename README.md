### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? She wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the 19th century. People didn't start building real modern computers until over 100 years later! Imagine trying to write code for a machine that didn't even exist!
