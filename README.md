### Today's fact

Here's a curious fact: the first computer "bug" was an actual, living bug. In 1947, engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University found a moth stuck in one of the components. The insect was causing an unexpected malfunction. They promptly removed the moth and taped it into the computer's logbook. Grace Hopper, a computer scientist and U.S. navy rear admiral, coined the term "debugging" to describe the process of removing errors from a computer program, inspired by this incident.
