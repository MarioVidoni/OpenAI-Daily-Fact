### Today's fact
# 
Did you know the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? She wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid 1800's. However, the machine itself was never built to carry out the operations. Thus, Ada Lovelace was quite literally ahead of her time!
