### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first actual computer "bug" was indeed a real insect? In 1947, a moth got trapped in a relay of a Mark II computer at Harvard University. Moth trapped were causing errors in the machine's functionality and was later removed and taped to a log book by the operators. Thus, the term "debugging" was coined. This makes debugging a much more literal term than we usually think!
