### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that in 1986, a bug in a single line of code in the software of a Soviet early warning system nearly started World War III? The false alarm for an incoming nuclear missile was fortunately recognized as a mistake by the duty officer, preventing a retaliatory attack. It turned out that the error in code led to a false detection when the satellite happened to align with the sun at a particular spot in the sky. Now that's a high-stakes debugging situation!
