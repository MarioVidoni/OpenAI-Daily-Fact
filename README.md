### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? She wrote the world’s first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid-1800s. People don’t usually associate the mid-1800s with computing, but Lovelace was way ahead of her time!
