### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer "bug" was actually a real bug? In 1947, a moth got trapped in a relay of a Mark II computer at Harvard University. The operators located the moth and removed it, making the first ever case of 'debugging'. It was recorded in the computer's logbook, and the logbook now resides in the Smithsonian Museum's History of American Technology.
