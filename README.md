### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace, and she worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, in the 1800s. Despite living in a time when women weren't typically engaged in such fields, Ada wrote what is considered the world's first computer program. Even more curious, she did this more than a hundred years before a computer, as we know it today, was even invented.
