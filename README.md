### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace and she wrote the first algorithm for Charles Babbage's theoretical "Analytical Engine" in the mid-1800s, a machine that was never built because of its astronomical costs and the limitations of the technology at the time. Thus, programming effectively pre-dates actual computers by nearly a century.
