### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? This is quite curious because at that time, in the 19th century, it was rare even for women to be scientifically educated. Ada wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine. Amazingly, her work later inspired Alan Turing's work on the first modern computers in the 1940s.
