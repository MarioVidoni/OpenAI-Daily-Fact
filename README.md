### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper. This machine was none other than Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, in the mid-1800s. She's often considered as the first to recognize the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer... all this before computers as we know them today even existed!
