### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? Not only is it interesting for gender representation, but it also goes all the way back to 1843. She is credited with writing instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s. Quite an achievement, especially considering computers wouldn't be invented for another century!
