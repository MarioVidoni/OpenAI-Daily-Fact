### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace and she wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper. This was back in the mid-1800s, a time when you wouldn't typically expect to find a female programmer!
