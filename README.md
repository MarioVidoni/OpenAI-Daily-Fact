### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer "bug" was actually a real insect? In 1947, a moth got trapped in a relay of a Mark II computer at Harvard University. The operators, including Grace Hopper who's a computing pioneer, removed the moth and taped it into the log book, coining the term "debugging". So, the next time you're debugging your code, remember you're figuratively hunting for "insects" in your programming!
