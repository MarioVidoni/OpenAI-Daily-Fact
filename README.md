### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the term "bug" in programming actually originated from a real insect? In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper discovered a moth stuck in one of the circuits of a computer and referred to it as the "first actual case of bug being found". Since then, the term "bug" has been commonly used to describe any issue or glitch in a program.
