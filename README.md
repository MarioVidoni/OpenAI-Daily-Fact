### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace, and she worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Despite the time she lived in (the 1800s) where women were rarely involved in science and technology fields, Lovelace wrote what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. So, she essentially created the concept of programming before computers even existed in their modern form. Quite a curious fact, isn't it?
