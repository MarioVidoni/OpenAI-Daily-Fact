### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace and she wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid-1800s. Lovelace was a mathematician and writer who became interested in Charles Babbage's difference and analytical machines, which were early precursors to the modern computer. Despite the technology of her time, she was able to conceptualize a method for the machines to repeat a series of instructions - a process known today as looping, a fundamental concept in programming.
