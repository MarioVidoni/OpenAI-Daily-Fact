### Today's fact

Did you know that the first ever computer "bug" was actually a real bug? In 1947, engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University discovered a moth stuck in one of the components, causing an error. This incident is where we get the term "computer bug" from. They even preserved the moth and it can now be found in the Smithsonian Museum!
