### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first programmer in the world was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. In her notes which explained the workings of the engine, she also included what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Hence, Lovelace is often considered the world's first computer programmer. Quite curious, isn't it?
