### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Ada Lovelace, the daughter of famous poet Lord Byron, was an English mathematician and writer who worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is recognized for writing the algorithm intended to be processed by the machine, which technically makes her the world's first computer programmer, all the way back in the mid-1800s!
