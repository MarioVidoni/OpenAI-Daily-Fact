### Today's fact

Did you know the first computer "bug" was an actual bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, and her team at Harvard discovered a moth stuck in their computer. This was causing a malfunction, so she removed it and taped it into her log with a note saying "First actual case of bug being found". That's how the term "debugging" a computer was born.
