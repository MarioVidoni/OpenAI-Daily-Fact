Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized as the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is credited with writing the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine in the mid-1800s. Now, that's some serious girl power in tech from the very beginning!
