### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, daughter of famous poet Lord Byron, wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid-1800s. But she never got to see her program run, because the machine was never built. However, her work has been recognized and she's now celebrated as the worldâ€™s first computer programmer. How curious that the world of programming, today often considered a male-dominated field, was pioneered by a woman!
