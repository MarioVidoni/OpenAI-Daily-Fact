### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? her name was Ada Lovelace and she wrote programs for Charles Babbage's analytical engine in the 19th century, which was a general-purpose computing machine. The interesting part? The machine was never built during their lifetimes, so her programs were never actually run. Ironically, she essentially wrote code for a machine that didn't exist yet. Talk about thinking ahead!
