### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the very first computer programmer was actually a woman? Countess Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized as the world's first programmer. She wrote the first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid-1800s, the Analytical Engine created by Charles Babbage. Talk about a pioneering spirit in an era where computing was largely theoretical!
