### Today's fact
# 
The first actual computer "bug" was a dead moth which was stuck in a Harvard Mark II computer in 1947. The term "bug" was used to describe an issue with the machinery; however, a literal bug getting stuck in the computer was an ironic twist and so the use of the term "debugging" (removing problems from a program) was consequently born.
