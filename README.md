### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first actual "computer bug" was a real bug? In 1947, a moth got trapped in a relay of a Mark II computer at Harvard University. The operators removed the moth and taped it in the logbook, coining the term "debugging." It's curious how real life incidents shape the terminology we use in programming!
