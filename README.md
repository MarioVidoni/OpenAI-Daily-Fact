### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is recognized as the first computer programmer. She worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. While Babbage designed the engine, Lovelace wrote the first algorithm intended for such a machine, essentially inventing programming language before computers even existed! That's not just curious, it's fascinating!
