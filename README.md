### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the world's first computer programmer was actually a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine and is often regarded as the first to recognize the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer. Quite a curious and empowering piece of history in programming!
