### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first programming language, called Assembly, was developed in the early 1940s? This language is pretty tough to understand as it's written in a binary format, essentially a series of 1s and 0s, and corresponds directly to machine code instructions. For a non-computer mind, it would be like trying to read a book written in an alien language!
