### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace? She worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, and wrote what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. This was back in the 1840s, long before modern computers were even conceptualized! Interestingly, she was also the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron. Quite a curious blend of arts and science in one family!
