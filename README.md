### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first programmer in the world was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized as the world's first programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. In her notes, she described an algorithm to be processed by the machine, marking the world's first algorithm intended for processing on a computer. This was all in the mid-1800s, long before the electronic computers we know were invented!
