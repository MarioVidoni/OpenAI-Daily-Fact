### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, making her the world's first computer programmer in the mid-1800s, a time when women could not even vote!
