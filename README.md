### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, making her the world's first computer programmer. This is certainly a noteworthy and curious fact, given that this occurred in the early 1800s, a time when the field was largely dominated by men.
