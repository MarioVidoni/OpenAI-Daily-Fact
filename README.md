### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first-ever computer bug was an actual bug? In 1947, a team of engineers working on the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator at Harvard University discovered a moth stuck in the machine. This moth was causing the machine to malfunction, and once they had removed it, they declared they had "debugged" the machine - thus coining the term we still use today for fixing code. The moth is still preserved at the Smithsonian Museum as the first "real bug" in a computer program.
