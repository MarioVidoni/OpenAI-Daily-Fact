The first computer programmer was a woman. Her name was Ada Lovelace and she worked on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Despite this historical fact, today's tech industry is often perceived as a male-dominant field.
