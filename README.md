### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first known computer programmer was a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace, and she worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. During her work, she wrote the world's first machine algorithm, hence is recognized as the first computer programmer. Very forward-thinking for the mid-1800s!
