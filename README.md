### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first ever computer bug was an actual bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computing pioneer, found a moth causing problems inside a mechanical computer. The incident was carefully documented and the term "bug" has been used to refer to software issues ever since. Curiously, the moth is still preserved at the Smithsonian Museum.
