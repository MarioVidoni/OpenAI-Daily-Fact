Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, a mathematician, is recognized as the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, back in the mid-1800s. It's quite a curious fact when you consider the gender disparity in the technology sector today.
