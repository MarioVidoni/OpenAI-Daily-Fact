### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the world's first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, a mathematician, wrote the world’s first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid-1800s. People didn’t begin to realize the full potential of her work until a century later. Quite curious, isn't it?
