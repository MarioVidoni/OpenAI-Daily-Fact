### Today's fact
# 
Did you know the first programmer in history was a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace and she worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, in the mid-1800s. So, the history of programming is actually attributed to a woman, even though today the field is predominantly male-dominated!
