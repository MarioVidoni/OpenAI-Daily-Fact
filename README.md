### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is recognized as the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, back in the mid-1800s, a time when the concept of a computer didn't even exist yet. Now that's some forward-thinking brilliance!
