### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first ever computer "bug" was actually a real bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth causing issues in the computer she was working on. She literally "debugged" the system and since then we use the term "debugging" to talk about fixing issues in our code.
