### Today's fact

Did you know that the first computer "bug" was actually a real insect? Back in 1947, engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University discovered a moth stuck in one of the components causing an error. Hence, they humorously referred to this as 'debugging' the system. This is believed to be the origin of the term "computer bug".
