Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is recognized as the first programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine in mid-19th century. Quite curious considering the gender disparity in the tech industry today, isn't it?
