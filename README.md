### Today's fact
# 
In 1965, a Soviet programmer named Alexey Pajitnov developed a computer game during his spare time to test the capabilities of a new type of computer. That game was 'Tetris', which went on to become one of the most popular video games in the world, yet Pajitnov didn't receive any royalties from it until 1996, because all software was owned by the Soviet government at the time.
