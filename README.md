### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, a 19th century mathematician, is recognized as the first programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. It's quite remarkable when we consider that this was a period when opportunities for women were severely limited. She wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper.
