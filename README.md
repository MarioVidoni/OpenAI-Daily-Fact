### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized as the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, in the mid-1800s. Despite the technology of the time, her notes on the engine include the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. This was way before the actual invention of modern computers! Quite a curious leap of foresight, isn't it?
