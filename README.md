### Today's fact

Did you know that the first known computer programmer was a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace, who in the mid-1800s, wrote what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Despite the common stereotype of male dominance in the tech industry, this historical fact serves as a reminder that programming and computer science is open to everyone!
