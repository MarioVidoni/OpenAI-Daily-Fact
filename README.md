### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was not only a woman, but she also lived in the 19th century? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Despite being from an era when women were not typically involved in such fields, she greatly contributed to the foundations of programming!
