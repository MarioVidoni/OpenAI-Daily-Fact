### Today's fact

Sure! Here's a curious and funny historical fact: The first actual computer "bug" was a moth. In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, discovered a moth inside her computer and jokingly referred to it as a "bug." She had to "debug" her system, hence giving birth to the terms 'bug' and 'debugging' in the programming world.
