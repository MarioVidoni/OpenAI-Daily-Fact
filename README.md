### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended for processing on such a machine. Hence, she is often regarded as the first to recognize the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.
