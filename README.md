### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, daughter of poet Lord Byron, received instruction from Charles Babbage on his early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is recognized for writing the world's first algorithm for such a machine. So in effect, the roots of programming are entwined with those of poetry!
