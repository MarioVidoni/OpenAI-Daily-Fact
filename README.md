### Today's fact
# 
In the early days of programming, computer programmers had to physically punch holes in cards to input code into a computer. This was a tedious and time-consuming process, and if a mistake was made, they had to start all over again. This led to the popular saying among programmers: "There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors."
