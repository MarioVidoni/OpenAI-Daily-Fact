### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. In her notes, she detailed an algorithm intended to be processed by the machine, making her the world's first computer programmer. All this happened in the mid-1800s, years before the first actual computer was even built!
