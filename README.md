### Today's fact
# 
In the early days of computer programming, programmers used to physically punch holes into cards or paper tape to input code into computers. These cards or tapes were then fed into the computer to run the program. This process was time-consuming and error-prone, leading to the term "bug" being used to describe a programming error. The first recorded computer bug was a real moth that got trapped in a relay of a Mark II computer at Harvard University in 1947, causing a malfunction. The bug was removed and taped to the logbook with the caption "First actual case of bug being found."
