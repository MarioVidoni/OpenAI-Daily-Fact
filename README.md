### Today's fact
# 
Did you know the first computer programmer was a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace and she wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid-1800s. Essentially, she was coding before it was even a thing! Quite curious and revolutionary for that time, wasn't it?
