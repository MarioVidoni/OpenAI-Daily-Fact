### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first actual computer "bug" was an actual bug? In 1947, a moth got trapped in a relay of a Mark II computer at Harvard University. The operators removed the moth and taped it in the logbook labeling it as the "First actual case of bug being found". This is where the term "debugging" a computer originated from.
