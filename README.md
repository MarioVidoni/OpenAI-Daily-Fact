### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first known computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is credited with writing instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s. However, the computer she wrote for, the Analytical Engine, was never built. It's quite curious to think she was pioneering a field for a machine that didn't even exist yet!
