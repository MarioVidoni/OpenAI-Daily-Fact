Did you know that the first programmer in the world was a woman? Ada Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron, is recognized as the first programmer. She worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Despite being of the 19th century, her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first published algorithm intended for processing on a computer. Now that's a fun and historical fact about programming!
