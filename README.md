### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer bug was actually a real bug? In 1947, engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University found a moth stuck in one of the components. They actually taped it in their logbook and labeled it as the "first actual case of a bug being found." That's why today we call coding errors or glitches 'bugs'. Quite a curious turn of events, isn't it?
