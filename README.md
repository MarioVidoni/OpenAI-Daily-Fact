### Today's fact
# 
The first computer "bug" was an actual bug. In 1947, Grace Hopper, a programming pioneer, was working on the Harvard Mark II computer when she found a moth causing trouble in a relay. This is where the term "debugging" originated from, which we use today to describe the process of finding and fixing issues in code. The moth is now preserved in the Smithsonian Museum.
