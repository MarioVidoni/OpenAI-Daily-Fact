### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first "bug" in a computer program was actually a bug? In 1947, engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University found a moth stuck in one of the components. This was causing an error, and so they dubbed it the 'first actual case of a bug being found'. The engineers taped the moth into their logbook and from that day forward, any problem with a computer program was referred to as a 'bug'.
