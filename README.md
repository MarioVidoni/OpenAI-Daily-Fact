### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first known computer programmer was a woman? It's true! Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is credited with writing instructions for the first computer program in the mid-1800s. However, the machine she wrote the program for, called the Analytical Engine, was not built in her lifetime. So she never got to see her program in action. This makes programming one of the very few fields where a woman was the pioneer.
