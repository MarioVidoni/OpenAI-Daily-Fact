### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer "bug" was actually a real bug? In 1947, a moth flew into one of the relays in the Harvard Mark II computer and its presence disrupted the operations. The operators "debugged" the machine by removing the insect, and thus originated the term "debugging" in the context of computer science. This makes "debugging" one of the few programming terms steeped in a literal truth!
