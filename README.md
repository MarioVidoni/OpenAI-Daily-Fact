### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first known computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, a British mathematician, is credited for writing the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper, in the mid-1800s. This was long before the invention of the modern computer. So, while we often talk about the field of programming as being male-dominated, it was actually started by a woman!
