## Today's Fact
# 
Did you know that the term "bug" in computer programming originated from an actual insect? In 1947, when engineers found a moth causing issues in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, they removed it and taped it to their logbook with the notation: "First actual case of bug being found." This led to the use of the term "debugging" for fixing software errors.
