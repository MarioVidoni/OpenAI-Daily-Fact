### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first programmer in history was a woman? Ada Lovelace, a mathematician and writer, is recognized as the first programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine in the mid-1800s. Even though the engine itself was never built in their lifetime, Adaâ€™s notes on the engine included the first algorithm intended to be processed by it, making her effectively the first computer programmer.
