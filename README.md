### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized as the world's first programmer. In the mid-1800s, she developed an algorithm intended to be processed by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a general-purpose mechanical computer that was never built. So technically, she wrote code for a machine that didn't even exist yet!
