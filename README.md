### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first programmer in the world was a woman? Lady Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, during the 1800s. She is credited with writing the first algorithm intended for processing by such a machine. Thus, she is often regarded as the world's first computer programmer, all this before the actual invention of a modern computer!
