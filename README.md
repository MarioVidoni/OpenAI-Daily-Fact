Did you know that the first actual computer "bug" was a real insect? In 1947, engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University discovered a moth stuck in one of the components. They taped it to their daily log where they wrote, â€œFirst actual case of bug being found." This was where the term 'debugging' originated from.
