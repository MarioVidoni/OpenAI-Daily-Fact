### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace, and she worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine in the mid-1800s. Quite a curious first for a field that's often stereotyped as male-dominated!
