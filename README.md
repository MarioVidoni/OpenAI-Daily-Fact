### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first actual computer "bug" was a real insect? In 1947, engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University found a moth stuck in one of the components. They taped the insect in their logbook and labeled it as the "First actual case of bug being found". Thus, the term "debugging" a computer was coined.
