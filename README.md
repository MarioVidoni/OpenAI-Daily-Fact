### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Yes, that's right. Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, is recognized as the world's first computer programmer. In the 19th century, she wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper. Quite curious isn't it?
