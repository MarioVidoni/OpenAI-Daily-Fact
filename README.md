### Today's fact
# 
The first computer programmer was a woman. Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is recognized as the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, making her the world's first programmer. Curiously enough, this was in the 1840s, long before the first computer was built!
