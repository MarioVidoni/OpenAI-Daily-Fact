### Today's fact
# 
Did you know the first known computer "bug" was an actual bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, and her team at Harvard discovered a moth inside their Mark II computer. This moth caused an error in the program they were running, hence they coined the term "debugging" a computer. The moth was taped into their logbook, which now resides in the Smithsonian Museum's archives.
