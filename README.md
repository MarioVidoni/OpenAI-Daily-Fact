### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace and she wrote the first machine algorithm for an early computing machine that existed only on paper in the mid-1800s. Thus, she didn't have the opportunity to test her algorithm on an actual computer, however, her work is considered as the World's first computer programming. Quite curious, isn't it?
