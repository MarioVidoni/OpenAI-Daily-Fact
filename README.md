### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first actual computer "bug" was a real insect? Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, and her team encountered a problem with the Mark II computer they were working on in 1947. Upon opening up the hardware, they found a moth trapped in one of the parts causing the fault. Hence, they coined the term 'debugging' for fixing issues in the system.
