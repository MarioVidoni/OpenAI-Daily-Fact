### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was actually a woman? Her name was Ada Lovelace and she wrote the world's first machine algorithm for an early computing machine in the mid-1800s. Even more interesting is the fact that this was a time when the concept of the modern computer didn't even exist! So technically, the first programmer wasn't a man glued to a screen but a 19th-century English Countess. Quite unconventional for her time, wouldn't you say?
