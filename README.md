### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the world's first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace, wrote her pioneering algorithm for Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, in the mid-19th century - a full century before actual programmable computers were built! Babbage never built his Analytical Engine, but Lovelace's notes became a significant document in the history of computers. Lovelace also envisioned that computers could go beyond numerical calculations, contrary to Babbage who only perceived the machine as a mathematical tool. These insights mark her as a prophet of the computing age. Now that's a curious fact for us tech enthusiasts!
