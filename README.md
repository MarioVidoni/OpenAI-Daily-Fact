Did you know that in the field of aerospace engineering, engineers study the wings of owls to inspire quieter aircraft designs? The serrated edges on owl feathers help reduce noise by breaking up turbulence and softening the sound of their wing flapping. This biomimicry approach could lead to more silent flight for airplanes in the future.
