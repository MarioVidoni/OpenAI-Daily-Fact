### Today's fact
# 
Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron, wrote an algorithm intended to be processed by a machine back in the mid-1800s. She did this for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, which was never built. So, she wrote code for a machine that didn't exist yet!
