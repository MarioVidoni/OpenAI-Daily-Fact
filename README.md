In software engineering, the term "rubber duck debugging" is used to describe a debugging technique where a programmer explains their code line-by-line to an inanimate object, like a rubber duck, in order to find and fix bugs. This practice helps programmers to identify issues and think through problematic areas in their code by verbalizing their thought process out loud.
